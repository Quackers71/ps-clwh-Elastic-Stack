## Elastic Stack
# Centralized Logging with the Elastic Stack: Getting Started

# Elasticsearch
# Logstash - *Data Collection Engine
1. Ingest
2. Enhance or modify
3. Forward 
- Aggregates, filters, and supplements log data
- Forwards altered logs to Elasticsearch
- Sending logs directly to Elasticsearch
  without Logstash can lead to inconsistent data

# Kibana
- Web-based front-end
- Works easily with Elasticsearch for charts,
  graphs, and visualizing data

# Beats
- Small, lightweight utilities for reading logs
from a variety of sources. Usually sends data
to Logstash.

Filebeat: Text log files
Metricbeat: OS & applications
Packetbeat: Network monitoring
Winlogbeat: Windows Event log
Libbeat: Write your own
- Using GoLang

Alerting
- Helps track conditions based on Elasticsearch
  data
- Continually monitors log data for pre-configured
  conditions
- Send notifications to email, Slack, Hipchat,
  and PagerDuty out of the box.

# Installing Elasticsearch on Linux (Ubuntu)
- Installation Instructions TBC
- Test Ubuntu using: cat /etc/issue.net
Ubuntu 16.10




# Introduction to Logstash
- Logstash Configuration
  input  {  Where is the data coming from
            Logs? Beats?
  }
  filter {  How should we parse the data?
            Ignore some? Modify any?
  }
  output {  Where should we store the logs?
            Backend? Elasticsearch?
  }

- Logstash Plugins
  Out of the box can read apache logs, log4j
  files, Windows Event log, and more...

  Included filters can read raw test, parse csv,
  or look up geo/location information by IP
  address, or reading json.

- Logstash filters
  grok filter - for parsing unstructured data
                and turn into structured field
                data for later use for searching
  geoip filter - Uses grok 1st to parse out the IP
